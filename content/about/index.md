Hi there! I'm a software engineering student from Indonesia *(or called Rekayasa Perangkat Lunak here).*
I mostly studied web development in class, altough I've been learning game development on the side as well. :)

I'm a founder/part for a small game-making group named Studio Tengah Malam (tranlates to Midnight Studio). Took the role of the programmer, designer, and artist. See our creation [here](https://studiotengahmalam.itch.io).

For contact, my username should be **@broccaoleracea** anywhere. ([GitHub](https://github.com/broccaoleracea)/Discord)
